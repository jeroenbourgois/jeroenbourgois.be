As part of a small research setup for one of our clients over at [Jack + Joe][1], we setup a minimal test project for two-factor authentication. It contains a Phoenix project and promotes a simple login flow with 2FA setup and subsequently 2FA login.

The full source code and instructions can be found in the source code and readme over at [Github][2]. No real blog post, most of it should be there.

We hope it can help some of you looking for a working example.
